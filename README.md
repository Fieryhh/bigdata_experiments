What actions can we take and how……


One of the ways to get sustainable projects off the grounds is by issuing the green bond or also known as [a climate awareness bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_bond).  It is a promise between its issuer and the investors. When an investor buys one of the bonds in effect, they lend the money to the issuers for a great period.  The issuer uses this money for its activities and in return, the issuer commits to repaying the investor with interest.  This sounds like the other bonds in the markets. But Green Bonds are specifically tailored to green projects.  The money that comes from the green bond can only be allocated to low-carbon projects such as renewables and energy efficiency. 

Over the years, numbers of corps, banks, and organizations set foot into the green markets. In 2014, Government-Backed Entity, Development Bank, ABS, Financial Corporate, Local Government, and Non-Finacial Corporate were playing their roles in the markets.  In 2017, when ABS was dominating the market, Financial Corporate has then surpassed all with the highest ClimatedBonds Type Issued. Then in 2018, Non-Financial Corporate and Government-Backed Entity catching up rapidly, both have reached the highest Issued Typed in 2020.  This shows that government and non-financial corporate, these two non-profit driven organizations have focused more than ever on solving an environmental problem and building a sustainable life. In 2016, loan and sovereign joined in as well, and they have been increasing their issued type since then.
